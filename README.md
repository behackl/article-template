LaTeX article template
======================

This is more or less for personal convenience. It contains
a template for new articles based on `amsart` and doesn't use
any particularly crazy packages.

For projects using this template: when changing the file
names `template.tex` and `template.bib`, make sure that
the file name in the CI pipeline compiling the file
(see `.github/workflows/build.yml`) is also adapted.
